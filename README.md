## 🧩 Agile Workflow (Simulated for Solo Development)

This project followed a sprint-based workflow, broken into four phases:

### Sprint Goals:
- Sprint 1: Design class structure for `Book`, `User`, and `LibraryManager`
- Sprint 2: Implement view, borrow, and return book functionalities
- Sprint 3: Add user login system and fine calculation using Java's `LocalDate`
- Sprint 4: Conduct manual testing for 20+ operations and finalize console UI
